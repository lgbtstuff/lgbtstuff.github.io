# lgbtstuff.github.io
An informative website covering a bit of LGBT terms, history, and legislation

I created this website after being approached by two friends who had no programming experience.
They accomplished all of the research for the site, and I did 100% of the programming

Please note that this was a learning experience for me, and thus might not have the most polished commit stream.
This was my first major project using Git, GitHub, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and YAHR.
YAHR stands for Yet Another HTML Replacement and was created by a good friend of mine as a more nicely formatted skin for HTML.
YAHR ReadMe: https://github.com/addonovan/webdev/blob/master/README.md

Lastly, please note that this is I, Garrett Wezniak, who created this.
My primary GitHub account is /garj4 and this was done under the account /carrotvegniak.
The reason for this external account was simply the sensitive nature of the content of the site
(and the not-always-so-sensitive nature of my high school).
Now that high school is over, I see no need to keep this information separate from my main account.
Note that this information is being posted by /carrotvegniak, an account that I intend to delete
after merging this repository with my main account.
