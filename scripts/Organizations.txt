Mattachine Society
The Mattachine society was founded by Harry Hay in 1950 and was an organization that sought to protect and promote the rights of gay men. The organization was completely anonymous and members pledged not to reveal any fellow members to the public. Its organization was based on that of the CPUSA at the time,another secret society operating in the dark. It hosted meetings were gay men could openly talk to one another about their sexuality.  In 1953 it came under investigation by the FBI and forced many of the founders to step down from leadership roles due to their affiliation with the communist party. After this, the Mattachine society became less prominent due to a weakened leadership.
